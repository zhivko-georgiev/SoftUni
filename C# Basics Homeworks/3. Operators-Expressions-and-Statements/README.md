##Operators, Expressions and Statements

1. Odd or Even Integers - Write an expression that checks if given integer is **odd** or **even**	.

2. Gravitation on the Moon - The gravitational field of the Moon is approximately 17% of that on the Earth. Write a program that calculates **the weight of a man on the moon** by a given weight on the Earth.

3. Divide by 7 and 5 - Write a Boolean expression that checks for given integer if it can be **divided** (without remainder) **by 7 and 5 in the same time**.

4. Rectangles - Write an expression that calculates **rectangle’s perimeter** and **area** by given **width** and **height**.

5. Third Digit is 7? - Write **an expression** that checks for given integer **if its third digit** from right-to-left is 7.

6. Four-Digit Number - Write a program that takes as input a **four-digit number** in format **abcd (e.g. 2011)** and performs the following: 
	* Calculates the sum of the digits (in our example **2+0+1+1 = 4**)
	* Prints on the console the number in reversed order: **dcba** (in our example **1102**). * Puts the last digit in the first position: **dabc** (in our example **1201**) 
	* Exchanges the second and the third digits: **acbd** (in our example **2101**). 
	
	The number has always exactly 4 digits and cannot start with 0.

7. Point in a Circle - Write **an expression** that checks if given point (**x, y**) is inside a **circle K({0, 0}, 2)**.

8. Prime Number Check - Write an **expression** that checks if given positive integer number n (n ≤ 100) is prime (i.e. it is divisible without remainder only to itself and 1).

9. Trapezoids - Write an expression that calculates **trapezoid's area** by given sides **a** and **b** and height **h**.

10. Point Inside a Circle & Outside of a Rectangle - Write an expression that checks for given point (x, y) if it is within **the circle K({1, 1}, 1.5)** and **out of the rectangle R(top=1, left=-1, width=6, height=2)**.

11. Bitwise: Extract Bit #3 - Using bitwise operators, write an **expression** for finding the value of the bit **#**3 of a given unsigned integer. The bits are counted from right to left, starting from bit #0. The result of the expression should be either **1 or 0**.

12. Extract Bit from Integer - Write an expression that extracts from given integer **n** the value of given **bit at index p**.

13. Check a Bit at Given Position - Write a **Boolean expression** that returns if the **bit at position p** (counting from 0, starting from the right) in given integer number n has value of 1.

14. Modify a Bit at Given Position - We are given an integer number **n**, a bit value **v (v=0 or 1)** and a position **p**. Write a sequence of **operators** (a few lines of C# code) that modifies **n** to hold the value **v** at the position **p** from the binary representation of **n** while preserving all other bits in n.

15. Bits Exchange - Write a program that **exchanges bits 3, 4 and 5** with **bits 24, 25 and 26** of given **32-bit unsigned integer**.

16. Bit Exchange (Advanced) - Write a program that **exchanges bits {p, p+1, …, p+k-1}** with **bits {q, q+1, …, q+k-1}** of a given **32-bit unsigned integer**. The first and the second sequence of bits may **not overlap**.
