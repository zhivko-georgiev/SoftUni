﻿Homework: Conditional Statements

1. Exchange If Greater - Write an if-statement that takes two integer variables a and b and exchanges their values if the first one is greater than the second one. As a result print the values a and b, separated by a space.

2. Bonus Score - Write a program that applies bonus score to given score in the range [1…9] by the following rules:

• If the score is between 1 and 3, the program multiplies it by 10.

• If the score is between 4 and 6, the program multiplies it by 100.

• If the score is between 7 and 9, the program multiplies it by 1000.

• If the score is 0 or more than 9, the program prints “invalid score”.

3. Check for a Play Card - Classical play cards use the following signs to designate the card face: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K and A. Write a
program that enters a string and prints “yes” if it is a valid card sign or “no” otherwise.

4. Multiplication Sign - Write a program that shows the sign (+, - or 0) of the product of three real numbers, without calculating it. Use a sequence of if operators.

5. The Biggest of 3 Numbers - Write a program that finds the biggest of three numbers.

6. The Biggest of Five Numbers - Write a program that finds the biggest of five numbers by using only five if statements.

7. Sort 3 Numbers with Nested Ifs - Write a program that enters 3 real numbers and prints them sorted in descending order. Use nested if statements. Don’t use arrays and the built-in sorting functionality. 

8. Digit as Word - Write a program that asks for a digit (0-9), and depending on the input, shows the digit as a word (in English). Print “not a digit” in case of invalid inut. Use a switch statement.

9. Play with Int, Double and String - Write a program that, depending on the user’s choice, inputs an int, double or string variable. If the variable is int or double, the program increases it by one. If the variable is a string, the program appends "*" at the end. Print the result at the console. Use switch statement.

10. Beer Time - A beer time is after 1:00 PM and before 3:00 AM. Write a program that enters a time in format “hh:mm tt” (an hour in range [01...12], a minute in range [00…59] and AM / PM designator) and prints “beer time” or “non-beer time” according to the definition above or “invalid time” if the time cannot be parsed.

11. Number as Words - Write a program that converts a number in the range [0…999] to words, corresponding to the English pronunciation.

12. Zero Subset - We are given 5 integer numbers. Write a program that finds all subsets of these numbers whose sum is 0. Assume that repeating the same subset several times is not a problem.
