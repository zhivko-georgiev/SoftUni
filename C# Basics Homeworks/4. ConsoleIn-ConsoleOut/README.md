Homework: Console Input / Output

1. Sum of 3 Numbers - Write a program that reads 3 real numbers from the console and prints their sum.

2. Print Company Information - A company has name, address, phone number, fax number, web site and manager. The manager has first name,last name, age and a phone number. Write a program that reads the information about a company and its manager and prints it back on the console.

3. Circle Perimeter and Area - Write a program that reads the radius r of a circle and prints its perimeter and area formatted with 2 digits after the decimal point.

4. Number Comparer - Write a program that gets two numbers from the console and prints the greater of them. Try to implement this without if statements.

5. Formatting Numbers - Write a program that reads 3 numbers: an integer a (0 ≤ a ≤ 500), a floating-point b and a floating-point c and prints them in 4 virtual columns on the console. Each column should have a width of 10 characters. The number a should be printed in hexadecimal, left aligned; then the number a should be printed in binary form, padded with zeroes, then the number b should be printed with 2 digits after the decimal point, right aligned; the number c should be printed with 3 digits after the decimal point, left aligned.

6. Quadratic Equation - Write a program that reads the coefficients a, b and c of a quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 and solves it (prints its real roots).

7. Sum of 5 Numbers - Write a program that enters 5 numbers (given in a single line, separated by a space), calculates and prints their sum.

8. Numbers from 1 to n - Write a program that reads an integer number n from the console and prints all the numbers in the interval [1..n],each on a single line.

9. Sum of n Numbers - Write a program that enters a number n and after that enters more n numbers and calculates and prints their sum. Note that you may need to use a for-loop.

10. Fibonacci Numbers - Write a program that reads a number n and prints on the console the first n members of the Fibonacci sequence (at a single line, separated by spaces) : 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, …. 

11. Numbers in Interval Dividable by Given Number - Write a program that reads two positive integer numbers and prints how many numbers p exist between them such that the reminder of the division by 5 is 0.
