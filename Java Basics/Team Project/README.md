##Teamwork Project Assignment

Design and implement a console-based game by choice. It could be a well-known game like Minesweeper, Tetris or Xonix or a game designed by your team.

You, as a team, are free to decide what platforms, development tools and team collaboration tools will use. You might perform live meetings in SoftUni or at some other location, online meetings, use chat systems, organize mailing lists, Facebook groups, use project management tools, source control tools and any other technical and non-technical resources to build your project, but please work in team. Each team member should be able to prove his or her contribution at the project live defense. Remember that each team member will get equal score at the project public defense.

* General Requirements

    - **Use Java** – the entire work should be implemented in Java
    - **Console-based application** – use the standard text console
        + Optionally, you may use some Java GUI library like Java FX, Swing or AWT
    - **Work in team** – all team members should contribute

* Deliverables

    - The complete **source code** of your project.
    - A **presentation** of your project (e.g. PowerPoint slides) or other brief documentation (1-2 pages) of your project. It should provide the following information:
